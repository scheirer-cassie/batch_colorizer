# batch_colorizer
A Google Colab program that automatically colorizes large amounts of black and white images.

# HOW TO USE
## Windows Only: Download 7zip
The colorizer requires a zip file containing an empty folder, and unfortunately Windows 10 automatically deletes empty folders in a zip file. The software 7zip overrides this.

* Windows 32-bit : https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1900.exe
* Windows 64-bit : https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1900-x64.exe

## Organize zips
Put all your black and white images into one directory, and make an empty folder in the directory titled "result_images".
